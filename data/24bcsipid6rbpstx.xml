Personnaly even if I had (in the past) used Unix, I don't like it. It
is
so... old, so archaic ; it is only good for geek. Apple failed to give
us a
true new Mac OS and used what they found : a unix system.

I know what you mean.  It's like Bach.  So....old, geeks are definately
the
only people that could find anything rewarding in it...jackass.  Sorry,
but
these sound like the words of Compaq user.

Alright, setting aside the path of destruction through history tread by
your
civilization (as it isn't particularly valid, just wanted to poke at you
again
: ) I think that if you take a moment to consider how many revolutions
in the
way we use computers have been based in Unix, even our precious macOS,
you may
reconsider the filthy old unix operating system.  No unix: no WWW, no
E-mail,
no Photoshop.  These things all started on Unix.  Hard to believe, I
know,
since it's so...old...barbaric.  I think that maybe you're confusing
grace of
the OS with it's learning curve, two elements that stand distinct.
