I *would* like to emphasize the point Mark is making

A fascinating perspective.  The "Guinness Book of World
Records" is one of the most popular books ever, and yet
it's full of nothing but trivia.  "Ripley's Believe It or

"Haydn's Dictionary of Dates".  That should tell us
something.  At one time some people wanted to delete the
multitude of lists found on Wikipedia, but these have
enormously attractive powers. 
There is more to an encyclopedia then stuffy narratives.
 If we're lucky it may even have the information we're
looking for.
