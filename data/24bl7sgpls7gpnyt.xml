Thanks for your response. I start running ZK on windows and let you know if
I run into issues.

If not, what would one need to do support windows and what would be the

Problems you might encounter would be things like NIO issues with the JVM
implementation on windows.

Probably what you'd want to do is run "ant test-core-java" or similar in the
top of the ZK release directory. This will run all the java tests and give
you some insight into status. I'd be happy to work with you to land patches
that address issues with ZK on windows. Depending on the interest level and
support from win users we could support win as a dev/prod platform at some
point in the future - having ongoing support for this would be important
though (people interested in testing/fixing under win I mean). Try
exercising under windows and create some JIRAs based on what you find.
