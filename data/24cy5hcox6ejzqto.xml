Google Group nor by a site you created for your group, since groups
are sites. Every Google Group has a discuissions section with on line
messages, which you may call a board, and every Google Group is a web
site, though limited in some ways.

another web sit if that is what you mean. The are one integrated unit,
membership list, Home page, discussions, pages and files sections,
managment task area, settings area. None of it can be disassembled.
You can change the order some units and you can "Hide" certain
sections which does not really hide them from any intelligent user.

If anyone knows of a way of accomplishing this task, please let me
