      Couple of things which I had noted down

</quotepara><quotepara depth="1">* In the prequsite list it would good be, if we explicitly mention that Solaris<br/>requires a primary partition for installation. Because people try to install<br/>Solaris on multiboot machine half-way through they recognize that Solaris<br/>requires a primary partition so they have to start all over again which is bad.

</quotepara><quotepara depth="1">* In the re-partition section
 <url>http://www.opensolaris.org/os/community/documentation/reviews/chapter1/ch01s03.html</url>

</quotepara><quotepara depth="1">- I d'nt see why we need the steps 1-5.  Is it just to know the current parition<br/>layout ??

</quotepara></quote><para depth="0">Pradhap is correct. When Dave and I put together the presentation for 
the user group, we wanted to show them how the disk was partitioned 
before we started the procedure, so we showed them what the Windows view 
of the disk was first. Those steps have no bearing on actually 
partitioning the drive.  You could start with  step 6, then step 1 and 
proceed with step 7, etc.... (renumbering them, of course).

</para><quote depth="1"><quotepara depth="1">- In the step 6, It would be better if we mention that burn the system-rescuecd<br/>iso image and reboot the system. Ask user to make sure that (CD/DVD)rom is first<br/>boot device so that it boots up with system-rescudecd.

</quotepara><quotepara depth="1">- Also we need to emphasize the repartition section aim is to create a free<br/>Primary partition.

</quotepara><quotepara depth="1">- The link "Home" in end of the page is broken points to wrong location. And the<br/>next link is blank it would good if it points to "Installing the OpenSolaris<br/>Software "

</quotepara><quotepara depth="1">* In the Installing the OpenSolaris Software section
<url>http://www.opensolaris.org/os/community/documentation/reviews/chapter2/</url>
-  There are lots of  typo "i install" this section need to replace those
-  Link "Home" at the bottom of the page is pointing to a wrong location
-  It would be better to have "Next" link

</quotepara><quotepara depth="1">* In "Configuring Xorg for nVidia for Solaris" section
<url>http://www.opensolaris.org/os/community/documentation/reviews/chapter3/</url>

</quotepara><quotepara depth="1">- It says "configuring wireless networking" which is not related to this<br/>section.

</quotepara><quotepara depth="1">- It would be better to add a trouble shooting tip:-
             Sometime after the installation of Solaris at first boot, if<br/>Xorg/Xsun not configured properly dtlogin goes for a toss so user need to reboot<br/>the machine with "-s"  option from grub  to land into "Single user" mode and<br/>then start installation.

</quotepara><quotepara depth="1">* In "Configuring Networking" section
 <url>http://www.opensolaris.org/os/community/documentation/reviews/chapter3/ch01s03.html</url>

</quotepara><quotepara depth="1">-  It would be good to add links for Ginetmenu and Netprof for wireless.
-  For ethernet card if user need to change the IP address/Hostname he has no<br/>clue where to start. So it would be better to add "sys-unconfig" command so that<br/>users need to runs and reboot the machine for setting it up.
