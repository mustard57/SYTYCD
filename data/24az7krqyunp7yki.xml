Sorry to self-reply here, but does anyone want to second this patch,

Dustin,
Thanks for following up on this.  After looking at your previous mail,
I've not reviewed the patches, but I do have a couple of suggestions.
While you did include summaries of your patches, they don't follow our
log message guidelines[1].  By submitting your patches with appropriate
messages, they are much more likely to get reviewed.

</para><para depth="0">The patch submission guidelines[2] also note that "a patch submission
should contain one logical change; please don't mix N unrelated changes
in one submission -- send N separate emails instead."  Sending five
patches in one mail may be a bit difficult for some people to grok.

</para><para depth="0">May I suggest either grouping the patches together in logical chunks, or
submitting them serially?  (Submit one, discuss, apply, repeat.)  It may
take more time that way, but the reviewers are more likely to understand
what each patch is doing.

</para><para depth="0">(I've also updated the subject to include the brackets around [PATCH] so
that it gets filtered correctly.)
