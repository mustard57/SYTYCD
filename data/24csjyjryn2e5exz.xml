                                         Input Required

</para><para depth="0"> Hi,
 On the last call we decided to form small maybe 2-3 person subgroups to "own"
 different elements of the specification going forward.
 The idea is that each sub-group would do a deep-dive on a proposed element of
 the specification in the IBM paper (e.g., CAS, Type-System, Abstract
 interfaces etc.).
 The initial task would be to critique the section, identify issues and make
 recommendations on how to take it forward to a final form. The TC as a whole
 would vote on the sub-groups' recommendations and action plans. The sub-groups
 would then take on the task to implement the agreed-upon action plan.
 Sub-groups will have leads whose responsibility it will be to share evolving
 comments/questions/issues as part of an email discussion with the whole TC.
 This is a critical component of the plan since the biweekly meeting will NOT
 suffice if everyone had to come up to speed on  recommendations during the
 calls.
 Please read the following sections in the paper (if you have not already) and
 send me your preferences for leading and/or joining 2 or more of the following
 areas. I think it is important to have non-IBM participation on all of these.
 Please also note that some of these sections are more straightforward than
 others and I imagine will take less time/effort.
 1. CAS Specification
 2. Type-system Language
 3. Type-System Base Model
 4. Behavioral Meta-Data Specification (challenging issues here)
 5. Processing Element Meta-data specification
 6. Abstract Interfaces
 7. WSDL Service Descriptions
 8. Aggregate Analytic Descriptor Specification
 9. SOAP Bindings
 10. Java Bindings (proposed as an appendix by TC but not in original paper)

</para><para depth="0"> (PLEASE RESPOND BY MONDAY OF NEXT WEEK -- Thanks.)
 Discussion Topics (or what may be considered open issues) are discussed in
 section 7 of the paper. These may turn into core specifications, or may more
 likely lead to recommendations rather than core specifications. This section
 has a number of sub-sections.They will require different treatment, any
 thoughts?
 We can decide on an approach for these at the next call.

        Dave
