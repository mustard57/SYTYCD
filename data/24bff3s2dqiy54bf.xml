NeXT had VFS

This lets it run on top of
other file systems.

I don't think this is accurate.  We did have a plug-in architecture
for additional file systems.. but we never had this..
</quotepara></quote><para depth="0">
Actually, we did, it was just never quite well documented.

Nope.  DOS was...  but not NTFS..
</quotepara></quote><para depth="0">
NTFS wasn't supported by NeXT/Apple, however, there was a free
implementation based on a user-level NFS interface, that used some
Linux code (I think) to support at least read-only NTFS access
(maybe it was even read/write, I never tested or installed the
software, for lack of need/want).

Apple has every claimed there would be.

They didn't, but maybe they expose the private Streams to sockets
conversion layer they must have somewhere to make BlueBox work
properly.
