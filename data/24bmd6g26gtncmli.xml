With the recent explosion in voice-to-text technology, we're also now
able to broadcast messages out and capture the recipient's replies by
transcribing them to text and delivering responses back to the sender.
Something like this is proving to be an invaluable service for
emergency response teams etc.

try to use an unabridged dictionary as your source, its probably going
to fail miserably.  Al, if you have some product that works with a large
lexicon, can you share the name of that product?

</para><para depth="0">A side note to this windows mobile 6.1 does its ASR via the net, in
essence it streams the audio to a system with more cpu power than the
mobile has.  This is aparently a standard feature of 6.1 so development
of such apps should increase in the coming years.  

</para><para depth="0">Windows mobile 5 was the first windows mobile to integrate a sip client
as part of the normal dialer, although MS left it to carriers to
provision, and information is slowly leaking out about the XML config
format, most carriers have disabled this (to the point of a lot of ROM
images not even having the DLLs required or registry settings to enable
the sip client).  This seems to be a progression along those lines, and
my guess will only continue.

incorporated into other apps so you have less of a clear line to know
what is online and what is not, and more importantly, when you are going
to be charged and when you arent if you dont have an unlimited use plan.
