You should first check whether the goals of Debian are compatible

   That is wrong.  Debian is using Linux just because it has been the
   most advanced choice from long time ago.  Debian is not Linux
   dependent in any way.

   I don't know if they will have enough motivation to do it. I

   I haven't proposed to adopt their rules, but start a new branch in

   I'm not blind, I'm just asking to do one more step.  Of course there

   Debian/OpenSolaris problem.  If the compatibility is that important
   some people, you can be sure nobody will use it.  Anyway, as long as
   the source code comes from OpenSolaris the compatibility should come
   from there.
