</para><para depth="0">In the interest of making the list helpful to more readers, I would much
appreciate it if request and reply messages of interest only to the original 
poster be sent to only the originator, and not to the entire list.
I believe that personal thanks and me too posts are important,
but only to the sender.

</para><para depth="0">No hard feelings if you hit the wrong reply command by mistake.
No need to bother replying or to apologize.

</para><para depth="0">Thanks much for your help.

</para><para depth="0">Hi. 
If I sent you this before, please forgive my imperfect memory.
But it also indicates that you are still posting in mime attached duplicate.

</para><para depth="0"> I appreciate your posts, and find them valuable.

</para><para depth="0">Please post in plain text = ascii, not attached mime.
This means set your mail program to post and answer in plain text mode.
If your mail program is set to automaticly attach, or post in both plain text
and html or rich text, it will add many lines of mime code, even if you include
only plain text ascii.
It will also include two copies of your post, more than doubling its size,
with the extra mime code.

</para><para depth="0">The solution to this problem is to set your e-mail program to default to 
posting and answering in plain text.

</para><para depth="0">Unlike Windows mail, unix Mail will not
detach and present mime encoded attachments.
Some of us read e-mail on line, and do not want to download and mime
unpack messages.

</para><para depth="0">It should be just as easy to simply paste in the relevant file.

</para><para depth="0">Of course I have no objection to mime encoding when it is necessary to attach 
programs. Its just cumbersome and unnecessary for plain text ascii posts.

</para><para depth="0">If you quote me, please put your comments first.
I have already listened to my questions.
