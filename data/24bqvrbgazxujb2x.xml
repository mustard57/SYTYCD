640x480. From  my understanding the standard has been 800x600 for over a
year now, how important is it to make sure that sites look ok on 640x480? Is
the user percentage worth the trouble?

A lot of clients have weird perspectives.  A Flash site I designed at 
800x600 was deemed "too big" for their screens - 17" monitors at 
800x600 resolution.  No matter what I did, they wound up insisting 
not only that the page show up at 640x480, but that the movie be 
formatted as "exact fit", i.e. stretch-o-vision, so that "if the 
viewer wants it bigger, he/she can have it bigger".   I swallowed 
hard, hoped for the best, and made a good site for them.  I just tell 
people to stretch it in proportion...
