</para><para depth="0">Notice that he makes specific mention of two and only two models of 
UMAX scanners. Notice that the UMAX Astra 2100U is not one of the

the Officially Supported list. As promised, VueScan does not work 
with the 2100.

you snipped, was:

</para><para depth="0">"If anyone ever writes an OS X native driver for low-end USB scanners 
such as the UMAX Astra 2100 I figure that they have a market... so 
long as the price is right."

</para><para depth="0">The fact that the 6450 may/may not work with VueScan is irrelevant. 
What is relevant is that UMAX has elected to not supply OS X drivers 
for the majority of its scanners, and that only a few are supported 
by a third party. As the 6450 is not officially supported, support 
for it may go away in later versions of VueScan. It would seem to 
indicate that it would be a bad idea to buy UMAX scanners if you 
intend to use OS X, based on the available info. It appears that 
their OS X support is, to put it kindly, spotty. It would be better 
to support another vendor, one which supports OS X.

</para><para depth="0">However, if someone is silly enough to buy a UMAX scanner despite 
_knowing_ about UMAX's lack of support, well I can't stop them.

 movement on the driver front, I suspect that most Astra owners will
 simply buy a new scanner which _does_ have OS X drivers, probably
 _not_ one from UMAX.
