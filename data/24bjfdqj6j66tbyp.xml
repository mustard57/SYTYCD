</para><para depth="0">You're really asking for two things:

</para><para depth="0">1)  A comprehensive indexed archive of a significant portion of the
available Linux documentation.  This is already being developed at:
<url>http://www.linuxkb.org/</url>

</para><para depth="0">2)  A "real language" parser to interface to that above database.  This is
*very* difficult to do and is rather expensive to purchase.  M$ for
example licensed the Ask Jeeves technology from them to power their own
knowledge base rather than try to develop their own.  If you know of any
OSS projects that are trying to duplicate this or know of a company
willing to trade promotional sponsorship for that technology, please
either tell me or have them contact me!  Of course if you're serious about
writing your own, let me know- we'd love to have you on our team.

could answer for themselves, if they knew which web pages / HOWTOs / FAQs to
read. Has anyone found/written a good "Ask Jeeves" clone for Linux? I know
there are GNOME-based apps which talk to search engines &amp; make it easy for
the user to pick the right web resource; perhaps someone could write a
wraparound script/shell to let users "Ask Linus"...

and it gave a list of seven or eight items, the first of which was the
kernel compilation FAQ (AFAIR). Maybe I'll write a Jeeves wraparound when
I've built my Linux box...
