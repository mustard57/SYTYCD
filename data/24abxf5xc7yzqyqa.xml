Even if scalability of the manual configuration requirements was an issue for<br/>CP's (I'm not sure it is, given the limited number of Operators that serve<br/>regions, and the typical relationships that already exist between Operators and<br/>CP's), there are are readily deployable means to automate such a process. I<br/>could fairly quickly build a web-enabled content management database application<br/>that initiates the necessary changes using whatever web form a particular<br/>Operator has defined. I'm sure this would not be a significant challenge for<br/>CP's and could even be an application provided by the Operator specifically for<br/>that purpose, to be used by the CP to manage the CT preferences for their site.

But I would<br/>recommend that we see how the market develops first.

It's simply not reasonable or practical from the CP perspective. That's why it's<br/>noted in the way it is with the reasons included.

</quotepara><quotepara depth="3">Jo: the point of including these clarifications is that in some cases the CT<br/>proxy will not be able to reliably depend upon semantic means of discovering<br/>which sites should and should not be transformed (and how). An allow/deny list<br/>is a practical way of supplementing the decision process, and a common practice<br/>by WAP proxy/gateway vendors for example. There is certainly a process of list<br/>management, that is typically outside standards scope, and the CT operator is<br/>responsible for the simplicity of the process (a business decision in the end).<br/>It does not have to involve "great difficulty" (a simple web form on a CT proxy<br/>operator's developer/CP support site is all that is needed). If the CT<br/>recommendations do not include this as an option, it must certainly at least<br/>*not* prohibit it: vendors must have the freedom to meet customer (CT proxy<br/>operator) requirements without being called "non-compliant", if compliance to<br/>W3C recommendations is considered important.

</quotepara><quotepara depth="4">I think we have a terminology problem here, I assume that what you're saying is<br/>that an "allow list" (i.e. a list of sites for which transformation is allowed)<br/>should be recommended practice? I don't think I agree, anyway, in that it means<br/>that the CP then has great difficulty in getting changes to the behaviour of<br/>their site noticed.
