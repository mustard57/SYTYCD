</quotepara><quotepara depth="1">the current (default) implementation of Lenya's repository and navigation

framework we can build our own implementations of it. Reading the API we
were happy to see the interfaces for Document, DocumentBuilder,
DocumentIdToPathMapper etc. But diving deeper into the core code we were
astonished to see that there was no way of making our own implementations!
Isn't Lenya extensible after all?

I'm very glad you're addressing this topic
(is this correct English? :) ), because it's bothering me for
quite a long time now. Of course, when the interfaces in
org.apache.lenya.publication were designed, we had in mind to
allow specific implementations. But it was a somehow half-baken
approach as we didn't provide the corresponding configuration
options (except for the DocumentIdToPathMapper in publication.xconf).

Yes, and it is bad and has to be changed ASAP.

We (especially Michael) are bothered about the whole sitetree concept.
I (the navigation framework was mainly designed by me) don't see
it as "the way to go" when designing components, but rather as
a utility when building sitetree-based publications.

Yes, a frequently critizised fact (e.g., Michael isn't pleased with
it at all).

This is for performance reasons.

At the moment, it's both.

I would be pleased to hear what the vision/ideas/plans are about the
extensibility of Lenya?
How about considering using the Avalon principals and implementing an Avalon
container? (I know Cocoon is currently trying to replace ECM by Fortress)
</quotepara></quote><para depth="0">
IMHO everyone of us should make familiar with the Avalon concepts.
We're using Avalon components for access control and in some other
areas, and I had very pleasing experiences with the framework.

concepts to the publication framework.
