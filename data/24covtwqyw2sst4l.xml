have changed across the entire product line?

</para><para depth="0">This used to "just work"-- I could visit a single location that would list all  
of the TIL [tech info library-- til.info.apple.com] articles that have changed  
in reverse date order.  Incredibly handy for those of us that use numerous  
different apple products in our day-to-day.

gone?  Or was it just moved and I haven't found the new location?
