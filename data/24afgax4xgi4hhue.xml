Subject: [Proposal] V2.1 Release Candidate

</quotepara><quote depth="2"><quotepara depth="2">I'd like to propose using what's currently in the xml-soap cvs
tree as release v2.1.  I've built the code and it's available for
people to play with at: <url>http://xml.apache.org/dist/soap/soap-nightly.zip</url>
I know there are still open issues but I'd like to push them out
until v2.2 - as I stated before there's no reason to not have a
v2.2 in the near future - and I do feel it's important to release
the good changes that have gone in over the past months.
Unless a committer votes -1 to even thinking about doing this
I'll wait a couple of days before creating a branch in the tree
and then by Friday we'll take a final vote on the quality of the code.
Sound ok?
