</quotepara><quotepara depth="3">I just downloaded as I am looking to add Word to my computer.  Now I
have a lot of different icons and info on my desktop.  Do I need all

bunch.  Please advise.

Firstly OOo (OpenOffice.org) is not Microsoft Office, so it does not
have Word. OOo is an office suite and contains similar programs.
The OOo equivalents are:
Writer = Word
Calc = Excel
Impress = Powerpoint
Base = Access

</quotepara><quotepara depth="2">From your description, it is not clear if you have run the installation
program, but the fact that you have a lot of icons on the desktop
suggests that you may have already done this.
Go to your "Start -&gt; All Programs" menu and see if you have the new
programs listed there. If so, then you can delete all of those new icons
from your desktop.
If you haven't installed the program, read the instructions
here:<url>http://download.openoffice.org/2.1.0/instructions.html</url>
There is also a link to an "Extensive setup guide" on that page.
