</para><para depth="0">My original goal for this document was that is something someone would
use once they had decided to post in the forums. So it should link from
other pages where that information has already been suggested, such as
here:

</para><para depth="0">The other information on encoding would turn this into more of an
instructional document, rather than a general guide for how to
communicate effectively. Perhaps that would work well as a sub-page?
I'd definitely say add one if you want? Perhaps another subpage that
provides detailed information on searching the forums (as well as how
to use Google to do so).

</para><para depth="0">Looks good. I like that it stresses the point about Drupal being a
volunteer community and that people can get involved themselves, as
well as the point about Drupal being an international community and
that sometimes users can come across as abrasive or rude because of a

</para><para depth="0">I think you should remove the centre paragraph of the /node/add/forum
and replace it with the 6 bullets. That, and a link to the handbookis a
very good thing IMO. People hardly read a lot of text, but do read
bullets. If they are interested they will read further, i think.

</para><para depth="0">I understand what you mean. But I'd be hesitant to include all that text
in node/add/forum because of usability concerns. Though I wonder if it
would work to just include the following bullets with a note and link
to the full text version:

</para><para depth="0">* Context-sensitive forum post titles.
* Detailed specifics.
* Ignore flames and rude tones.
* You get more bees with honey than with vinegar.
* With volunteer support, not everyone gets a response.
* Enable your contact tab. 

</para><para depth="0">These could also be revised so that they become clearer when separate
from the larger explanations yet still remain short. Perhaps,

</para><para depth="0">* Use context-sensitive forum post titles.
* Include detailed specifics.
* Ignore flames and rude tones.
* Be polite.
* With volunteer support, not everyone gets a response.
* Enable your contact tab.

</para><para depth="0">Mon, 24 Oct 2005 17:35:27 +0000 : webchick

</para><para depth="0">I would maybe do:

</para><para depth="0">* Please [search] (link to search) and check the [handbook] (link to
handbook) before posting.
* Please use descriptive titles -- this allows people to better assist
you.
* Include detailed specifics -- Drupal version number, specific error
messages, steps you've tried, and so on.
* Ignore flames and rude tones -- remember that English is not
everyone's first language.
* Be polite -- you are more likely to get a helpful response.
* Remember that with volunteer support, not everyone gets a response --
please do what you can to help out!
* Enable your contact tab -- this allows people to contact you outside
of the forums if required.

</para><para depth="0">This is still not *too* wordy, but expands on the points more than just
the bullets themselves. I also changed "context-sensitive" to
"descriptive" titles, because the former is a bit unclear, imo. And I
added a bullet point for the search and handbook, per Boris's comment.

</para><para depth="0">No, I imagine you were right. IMHO, the whole About book needs to be
reorganized and revised. It just doesn't work well as a text that leads
new people through where they need to go (I have trouble finding stuff
in it), and, as I think we have seen lately with the anti-Drupal
sentiments in the forums, it needs additional information that helps
people to make better decisions about Drupal and understand what Drupal
is all about.  This is something I had hoped to take on in about two or
three months.

</para><para depth="0">I would change the italics to bold as the italics seem to disappear in

also including info on how to use blockquote, code, and ?php would also
