template for the User Guide.  He has also written a HOWTO explaining how 
to use it.

</quotepara><quotepara depth="1">We haven't figured out how to download files from Plones.  So I put up 
those documents in the old web page:

</quotepara><quotepara depth="1">Tim, could you exlain to us how to migrate a document from one template 
to another?  What is the best way to do that?

</quotepara></quote><para depth="0">The only way I know of is very tedious. Cut and paste into the new 
template, then go about applying the correct styles (OOoHeading1 for 
Heading1, and so on). I guess better done now than later. I will go to 
work on the Impress doc, and this is all stuff that can be done over 
time (it will take me a while for the 50+ page Impress guide). 
Eventually we should have all docs with the same styles though. The most 
important thing is to start using the template for all new docs right away.

</para><para depth="0">I do recall seeing someone on the Users list some time ago mention 
something about Find and Replace for styles (is that vague enough for 
ya?). However, I can't remember what the final answer was, whether or 
not this is something that OOo is capable of. I'll check it out....

</para><para depth="0">Also, as editors, it's up to Jim T. and myself to make sure that all 
docs are formatted consistently (of course, any help will be greatly 
appreciated). It's not really hard, but as I said, tedious. But once all 
docs are formatted consistently it will be much easier to integrate them.

</para><quote depth="1"><quotepara depth="1">Also, I have a question about the front page.  We are currently thinking 
of dividing each guide (e.g. Migration Guide) into several parts, so 
different volunteers can work on different sections simultaneously.  
Now, does it really make sense for each small section to have a front 
page?  I figure that there should be only one front page per guide.
</quotepara></quote><para depth="0">
</para><quote depth="1"><quotepara depth="1">Also, regarding the copyright notices.  What should we do with those 
when the documents are compiled into one single User Guide?  Does it 
really make sense to have 40 copyright notices sprinkled every 7 pages 
in the User Guide?

</quotepara></quote><para depth="0">The idea of the template is to give authors everything they need to 
format any doc for OOo. If they don't need the title page, they can 
delete it. Same with the TOC, Index, PDL, etc. However, if they do need 
any or all of these, then they are conveniently there for the authors to 
use.

</para><para depth="0">If an author is frequently writing small sections without a TOC, Index, 
PDL, and so on, he/she could delete the unnecessary stuff and save a new 
OOoLite template that still has all the relevant OOo styles. An author 
can make as many of these customized templates as she/he needs. Does 
this make sense?
