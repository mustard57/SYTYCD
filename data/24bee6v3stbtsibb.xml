Clearly, some of the drivers (input-elo2300, etc.) are not being kept

drivers have no current maintainer, and, hence, are probably going to
be broken.

That's nice; I wish I'd know about that before. Now, it would be nice
if the average user knew about that. It would also be nice if
unmaintained modules were not distributed in the katamari releases.
This definitely gives the impression that all the modules should work
(and build).
