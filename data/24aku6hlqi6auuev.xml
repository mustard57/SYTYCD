OK. I am not sure I am getting what is the specific problem you are
trying to solve with the Polygon though (yes, I asked for the big
picture, and now I am lost with it :$ ). Are you trying to do numerics or
visualization? If visualization, what are you trying to represent? Do you
need any interaction with it, and if so what exactly?

</para><quote depth="1"><quotepara depth="1">   this is why i asked so many possibly stupid questions, but since i
   really could not find good documentation (btw. the tutorials are
   really cool and help a lot but there is a lack of design patterns

   examples, since it was too ineffective (and i was sure that my
   problems are trivial, but the complexity arrises with the interplay

Yes, I know what you mean. The documentation is fairly narrative and
easy to follow for simple problems, but when it gets to more complex
stuff, you are on your own, trying to gather information around for the
VTK books and doxygen manual, for the random examples you find googling,
... This is partly because it is so hard to document. VTK is a huge
library, with infinite combinations, and we are exposing all of it. In
addition, documentation is driven a lot by the questions asked on this
mailing list, which help us structure our narration in a way that is
easily discoverable by users. So far, not many people had dug as far as
you are digging without sitting next to a developer (as you say ;&gt;). But
this can be improved, we can try to figure out what are the patterns that
you had to discover and that were not obvious in the beginning. If we can
get a good narration, with examples, we can add them to the
documentation.

</para><para depth="0">Would you be willing to take some notes and gather small examples. I can
go over the examples with you to make sure that we document things the
easiest way possible. We can both learn from each other in this process.
I think we could add a subsection 'Interacting with the visualization' to
the 'Building application with Mayavi'. And maybe, if we find that you
have questions on data structure that are not well answered by the data
structure documentation, we can add some paragraphs or subsections to
this documentation.

This looks very cool. I am happy that you can get nice things like this
done with the tool stack.
