Nothing that makes any real sense, but perhaps this is a clue.  When I
run <url>http://tool.motoricerca.info/spam-detector/</url> against that site, it
picks out "Welcome To Wedding Wheels Ltd - Wedding Car Hire &amp; Special
Occasion Transport" as potentially hidden text.

</para><para depth="0">This is a bit odd, because I've seen the same tool fail to pick up
text that was, IMO, much better "hidden".

</para><para depth="0">IF Google has banned the site - which seems the case - and IF it was
because of this piece of text triggering the same alarm in the
Googlebot that the tool above found and IF that's really a false
positive then we have another Googlebug.  I'd suggest that you change
the presentation of that line on the page - even though there's
nothing malfeasant about it - and submit a reinclusion request.

the way America behaves int he world these days.
