</para><para depth="0">One of the things I run into at times is when someone mails me and says 
"am I still on the list? Is something wrong?"

</para><para depth="0">And what I generally do is do a find_members and send them the result. 
Much of the time, it's a list that's gone quiet, sometimes it's a 
problem on their end.

</para><para depth="0">but I was thinking today, as I did this, that it'd be nice if 
find_members had a verbose flag that would optionally print out a 
summary of the user settings, so I could tell at a glance (and forward 
to the user) things like digest mode or nomail settings, since a person 
could be nomail and you can't really tell without using the web 
interface....
