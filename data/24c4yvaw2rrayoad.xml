</greeting><para depth="0">
Changes since 20100721:

</para><para depth="0">Linus' tree gained a build failure for which I applied a patch.

</para><para depth="0">The vfs tree still lost its build failure.

</para><para depth="0">The net tree lost its conflicts.

</para><para depth="0">The sound tree gained a conflict against the arm tree.

</para><para depth="0">The input tree gained a conflict against the s5p tree.

</para><para depth="0">The block tree gained a conflict against the scsi tree.

</para><para depth="0">----------------------------------------------------------------------------

</para><para depth="0">I have created today's linux-next tree at
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git
(patches at <url>http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/next/</url> ).  If you
are tracking the linux-next tree using git, you should not use "git pull"
to do so as that will try to merge the new linux-next release with the
old one.  You should use "git fetch" as mentioned in the FAQ on the wiki
(see below).

</para><para depth="0">You can see which trees have been included by looking in the Next/Trees
file in the source.  There are also quilt-import.log and merge.log files
in the Next directory.  Between each merge, the tree was built with
a ppc64_defconfig for powerpc and an allmodconfig for x86_64. After the
final fixups (if any), it is also built with powerpc allnoconfig (32 and
64 bit), ppc44x_defconfig and allyesconfig (minus
CONFIG_PROFILE_ALL_BRANCHES - this fails its final link) and i386, sparc
and sparc64 defconfig. These builds also have
CONFIG_ENABLE_WARN_DEPRECATED, CONFIG_ENABLE_MUST_CHECK and
CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO disabled when necessary.

</para><para depth="0">Below is a summary of the state of the merge.

</para><para depth="0">We are up to 166 trees (counting Linus' and 22 trees of patches pending
for Linus' tree), more are welcome (even if they are currently empty).
Thanks to those who have contributed, and to those who haven't, please do.

</para><para depth="0">Status of my local build tests will be at
<url>http://kisskb.ellerman.id.au/linux-next</url> .  If maintainers want to give
advice about cross compilers/configs that work, we are always open to add
more builds.

</para><para depth="0">Thanks to Jan Dittmer for adding the linux-next tree to his build tests
at <url>http://l4x.org/k/</url> , the guys at <url>http://test.kernel.org/</url> and Randy
Dunlap for doing many randconfig builds.

</para><para depth="0">There is a wiki covering stuff to do with linux-next at
<url>http://linux.f-seidel.de/linux-next/pmwiki/</url> .  Thanks to Frank Seidel.

</para><footer type="signature" depth="0" hash="232830165596128212">--
