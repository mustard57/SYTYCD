</para><quote depth="1"><quotepara depth="1">As far as Greg's intervention, it hardly seems in line with "the Apache
Way"
to quake in fear of the presence/intervention of any individual, ASF
chairman or other.  I appreciate Greg's POV, I'm happy to hear what he has
to say, and am more than happy to discuss the issue with him.  I'm sorry
this sort of open dialogue doesn't please you, but it hardly seems
catastrophic or even to be a major issue.
</quotepara></quote><para depth="0">
When you came into this project, we gave you huge lattitude to make changes
to the code base.  We trusted you to make those changes you showed interest
in the project, fixed things that people wanted fixed, and generally
improved it.  And we all respect you for what you've done.

</para><para depth="0">"The Apache Way" is about trust and respect... Greg is someone who's trusted
a lot of people, and I think has earned a huge amount of respect.  This
isn't quaking in fear... it's a response of... my gosh, I'm only working on
my one project and have no idea how much it's costing those people in
California to support my CVS account and emails and downloads... he asks
that we start considering this, and so we listen.

</para><para depth="0">Also the open dialogue quickly ends with a -1 vote.  Because of the Apache
voting rules, when someone votes -1, the conversation is just about over.
We can lobby the vetoer, but more than likely whatever brought that person
to veto will not likely change.  And even if the person was open to change,
the lobbying is draining to the community, the lobby'ers, and the vetoer.
Perhaps you don't appreciate how negative your voting is appearing to the
community.

</para><para depth="0">Anyway, I'm done lobbying for you to change your veta of the pop3-filestore
bug.  You have the right to block any bug fixes and push the release out.
So be it.
