static member from a model in the view (perhaps to set a key for a button
click event) - the controller could also access this static variable and act
accordingly - this is not neccesarily an inherently *very* bad thing. I'm
working on an online multiplayer game at the moment that works very nicely
using this methodology throughout the app - which is constructed of dozens
of MVCs.

other keys.

or is not MVC is not really that important - not as important as having
something that works well and is easily extended/adapted. If it has a Model,
a View and a Controller then it can be called MVC - but as Marcelo rightly
points out it might not necessarily adhere strictly to the GoF MVC.

They don't. There's indeed a view reference on the controller class, but
the model and the view communicate through the observer pattern: when the
model gets updated, it broadcasts an event (notifyObservers), the viewer's
then get notified about the change and can do whatever they want with the
new data. There's not direct reference between them.

adhere strictly to the GoF blueprint and I don't think that just becouse of
that they are not MVC.

Then it must not be MVC, because if you're talking about MVC
