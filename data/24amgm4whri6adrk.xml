Agreed. Python is more dependent on a reasonable editor than other 
languages, if only for this feature. Depending on the OS you're using, 
you may already have such editors. For example, vi (or better vim) is 
available on all UNIX-based systems. Most IDEs should support block 
indent/undent as well.

BBEdit which also supports this.

</para><para depth="0">If nothing else, a reasonable editor also supports syntax coloring 
which I used to scoff at but now find quite useful.

</para><para depth="0">With something like BBEdit, you simply select the lines in question and 
press CMD-] to indent and CMD-[ to undent. It's faster and more 
reliable than killing/adding braces at both ends.

</para><para depth="0">I also agree with the 2nd ed Learning Python recommendations. I've 
programmed for over 20 years, so it might be a little hard to tell what 
a total novice needs, but it is well-written and looks useful for all 
levels.
