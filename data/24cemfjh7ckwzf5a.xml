For the HTTP header fields it's fairly simple; they're US-ASCII period. For
that bogosity called "META" the waters are substansially more muddy.
Especially since there aren't any clear rules for whether the charset in

Surely that at least is clear: HTTP headers take precedence over

But *ML rules don't apply to HTTP, so whence the conclusion that
*anything* is implicit (as opposed to absent) in the headers?
Sure, if we take the whole thing (*TP transmission + *ML document),
then we can start to talk about undeclared charsets being implicit.

We are happy with SYSTEM FPIs.  It's the No FPI case (or FPIs which
are not accessible to the validator) you need to complain about.

Have you never had to do someone elses job because they made too
