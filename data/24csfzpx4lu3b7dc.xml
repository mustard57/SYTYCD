Focus on *your* efficiency first, not the computer's.  If you're doing
line-oriented processing, read it a line at a time.  If you're doing
pattern matching that spans line boundaries, you'll probably want to read
the whole thing in.

Don't worry about the implementation - smart people have done that for you
in optimizing the underlying code already.  If you don't benchmark
different ways of doing something then your guesses as to which is more
efficient than another are unreliable.  And don't bother benchmarking
until you find out that performance improvement is necessary.
